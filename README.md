## What I Learned
- Understanding Turtle Graphics and How to use the Documentation
- Importing Modules, Installing Packages, and Working with Aliases
- Python Tuples and How to Generate Random RGB Colours

## Challenges and Solutions
### Challenge 1 - Create Turtle and Draw a Square: 
Used Turtle class to create a turtle object, gave it color and shape, and moved it on a screen creating a square.
### Challenge 2 - Draw a Dashed Line
Drew a dashed line using the penup() and pendown() methods
### Challenge 3 - Drawing Different Shapes
Used turtle module to draw different colored shapes - triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, nonagon, decagon 
### Challenge 4 - Generate a Random Walk
Used turtle module to draw a random walk using random colors from a list
### Challenge 5 - Draw a Spirograph
Drew a spirograph with a radius of 100, 120 circlues, anglel increment of 3, using random colors from my random color generator 
## Final Project: The Hirst Painting
Used colorgram.py to extract colors from an image and saved a list of tuples with the different RGBs.
Moving top to bottom, I filled 10 random colored dots across the screen from left to right, 50 paces apart, dot size of 1 filled color.
